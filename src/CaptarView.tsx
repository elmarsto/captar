      Obsidian *only* calls this after unloading a file, before loading the next.
      Specifically, from onUnloadFile, which calls save(true), and then optionally
      calls clear, if and only if this.file is still non-empty.  That means that
      in this function, this.file is still the *old* file, so we should not do
      anything here that might try to use the file (including its path), so we
      should avoid doing anything that refreshes the display.  (Since that could
      use the file, and would also flash an empty pane during navigation, depending
      on how long the next file load takes.)

      Given all that, it makes more sense to clean up our state from onLoadFile, as
      following a clear there are only two possible states: a successful onLoadFile
      updates our full state via setViewData(), or else it aborts with an error
      first.  So as long as setViewData() and the error handler for onLoadFile()
      fully reset the state (to a valid load state or a valid error state),
      there's nothing to do in this method.  (We can't omit it, since it's
      abstract.)
