# Captar
Minimalist Obsidian plugin for managing inventory with QR codes.

Captar allows you to take a pic with a camera, interpret any QR codes found in the image (assuming they are URLs) and insert `![<pic-path.jpg>](<first-qr-code-found-in-pic>)`.

That is, it simplifies the process of making eyeball-searchable overviews of all your stuff, where you can click any given image to be taken to the URL borne on the first QR code found in the image. (If there is no QR code visible in a given pic, a default URL can be provided; see the settings tab).
